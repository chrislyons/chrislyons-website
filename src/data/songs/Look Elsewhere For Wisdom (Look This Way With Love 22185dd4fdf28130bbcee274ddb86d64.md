# Look Elsewhere For Wisdom (Look This Way With Love)

C. Lyons

I tried telling everyone I was drowning,

they said “swim.”

I tried telling everyone I was hungry,

they said “eat, put some meat on your bones.”

I tried telling everyone I was always stoned,

they said “how in the hell are you always stoned?!”

I asked everyone about what they know,

they said “go figure it out on your own.”

So I’ve been wrestling.

Contemplating.

I woke up one morning

I was all alone, thinking

“How in the hell can I live alone?”

I tried telling everyone I was so alone,

they said 

“Sorry, I’m no help to you.

Why don’t you find a woman?

Why don’t you find your woman?”

Why don’t you find your woman…

I said “I’m getting older…”

They said 

“Don’t worry, she’ll come to you.

Don’t worry, she’ll come to you.”

They said 

“Love is gonna find you.”

And I said “Oh,

but I’ve been running so long.

And right now I’m running low on answers.

You’d better look elsewhere for wisdom.

Look this way with love.”
