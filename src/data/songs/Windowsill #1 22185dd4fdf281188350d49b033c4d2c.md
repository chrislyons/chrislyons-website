# Windowsill #1

C. Lyons

Three disfigured gentlemen

on their way back from backgammon.

The ladies in waiting are always

oh-so elegant:

lanterns in windows

and love notes in their pantyhose.

Type-written lover prose,

and windowsills of primrose,

got to be good.

You say that I’m your friend

but I love you like a lover.

You say that it’ll never end

but I love you like no other.

Be good to me

cuz I’m so good for you.

Be good to me

cuz I’m so good for you.

Wise beyond your years,

I can see you pushing daisies.

And I’m passing by the grave

thinking my I miss the memories.
