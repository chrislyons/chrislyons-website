# Holding Pattern

C. Lyons

Dearly Beloved,

I’m feeding that pain!

I keep flashing back

to when I met you.

We’ve gotten a little more

solemn but we’re largely the same.

A little bit older, if I’m pressed to.

You used to come around here

but something changed.

Coulda stayed quiet, chose not to.

Classic example of our favourite game:

playing our parts impromptu.

So turn that radio up,

let’s hear what they say!

Time’s ticking louder

since I told you.

I’ve got no place to go,

nobody to see,

All I need is you

to trust me.

We’re in this

holding pattern, babe

that’s how it goes

you let me know

when and where

I should fall.

We’re in this

holding pattern, babe

that’s how it goes

you let me know

when and where

I should fall.
