# Windowsill #2

C. Lyons

Modern people living life in a vial:

bodiless social chemistry.

Reaching out to find 

a piece of what is real.

Stuck inside a marketplace,

wheeler deals.

Sittin on the windowsill

as it passes me by.

Sittin on the windowsill

and laughing it off, 

laughing it on.

Silly little men and women running dailies,

Spending time sipping tea, making babies.

Try to get ahead, try to get ahead.

It’s a beautiful day to be dead.

Riding the carousel 

and moving from scene to scene 

to scene to scene.

Everyone’s pants are down

moving from dream to dream 

to dream to dream.

And we’ve been told before.
