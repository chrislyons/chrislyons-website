# The House Song

C. Lyons

Gonna build a house

in my mind:

gonna find a plot of land

and measure it by hand.

And there I’ll go

when I need to unwind,

sit in my wooden chair

and swim the seas of time.

Walls displaying all my memories,

windows looking out on the dawn.

A lawn that has been dusted

with evergreens,

and a pond for the swans.

When I fall in love

then I’ll take her there

but until that day comes

this house won’t even be there.
