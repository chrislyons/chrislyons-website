# Fins Of A Shark

A. Smith, C. Lyons

Wednesday morning

and you see right through

all the past stuck staring 

right back at you,

you’re at the point where

even hello is the end

and that’s the last knife

stuck in your back, my friend.

It’s the second time today 

that I’ve had to call to get you

standing back up on the ground.

The bigots can try 

but they’ll end up purple,

the fins of a shark

make them swim in circles.

When every little hitch

catches up with you

and cuts a path into

everything you’re trying to do,

it’s the art of forgiving 

that makes you mend

and that’s a trick that

you’ll have to pick up, my friend.

It’s the seventh time today

that I’ve had to call

to tell you everything 

will be alright.

The bigots can try

but they’ll end up purple,

the fins of a shark

make them swim in circles.
