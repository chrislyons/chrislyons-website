# I, the Hog-Tied Villain

C. Lyons

These are my feet just trodding along.

The well-beat path, the thought-out song.

There’s nothing left to do no more,

there’s no one left to top this score.

They cast their boat off of the shore,

and they’ve sailed away for so much more.

This team of bandits that I once cared for!

I gave my words, my mixed up thoughts.

Tangled crosswords, in their knots.

Traded round across the fire

through many many many 

many nights of wood and wire.

But now my hands are tied and I can’t see.

My dreams are fried and I can’t breathe.

I’m up in the corner with myself as company.

Distances they blur our history,

distances they blur our history. And 

your covered ears are only closed doors.

Through all our rambles in the open

nary a word in vain was spoken,

merry we were to not be broken,

happy to lose ourselves in old Hoboken.

But I see you’ve moved along in your mind,

travelling off for another ride.

Leaving me alone here by my side.

Dear I wish you so well, though I fear 

I won’t do nearly quite as well now. 

And your lips are only lids upon the ink well.
