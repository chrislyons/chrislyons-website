# There & Back Again

C. Lyons

I find myself feeling younger

though I’m older;

every day another step away.

And though I backtread 

through my mind

I’m moving on:

there’s nothing to go 

back to anyway.

There was a time when we’d be

rolling through the country

with laughter as our gasoline -

fortunes few and far between.

You should have seen us

with our hearts wide open,

we’d be singing & dancing

like we were on a movie screen.

And we headed home when

morning came too soon,

blowing kisses at the moon.
