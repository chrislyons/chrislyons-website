# Mayday

C. Lyons

Saving yourself by the threads of a dangling rope

tied around your wrist.

It’s a long long list of things you wish you’d forget,

things you wish you’d let go

And you’re looking down on things you wish you’d never seen,

people you wish you’d never been

With the wind in your ears, remembering what it’s like to be dead

& how you’re better off instead.

In a freefall.

The lake’s full of waves and you’re almost safe,

you’re almost safe.

And it may be days til you see yourself in reflections

of time that passes away.

Lose yourself in the haze of hopeless opportunity

ever wishing to be free

In a freefall.

This life is a maze and you’re the one in its cage:

wander wall to wall to wall to wall.

The minotaur is strong but he dies by your blade

and you’re the only one to save.

Heaven in a casket or hell in a handbasket,

and I say come what may.

No time for illusion, no time for confusion,

I’m crying Mayday.

In a freefall.
