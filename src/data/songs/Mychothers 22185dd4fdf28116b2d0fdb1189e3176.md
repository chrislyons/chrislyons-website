C. Lyons

Lonely boy,

he knows there’s something wrong

but he won’t stop from keeping on.

He’s up at the crack of dawn

drawing pictures.

Grey skies overhead,

castle on the riverbed.

Somehow it still feels the same.

Somehow it still feels the same

through all these changes, changes.

It’s the same though my mind changes.

Lonely boy, looking at the wall.

He loves the beauty of it all.

Looking at the wall and wondering, wondering:

where I might be today,

where I was just yesterday…

reflecting.

Seeing himself when all he should see are his others.

But he’s hiding out ‘neath the covers.

He won’t play their game today.

Seeing so much in the things that could be more,

seeing no reason to walk right through the door.

Seeing solipsistically.

He’s the only boy that knows me so well,

and I know him just as well.

He knows he’s not the only lonely boy.

Lonely boys, trying to get through.

Trying to find what they have to prove.

When they’re only boys.
