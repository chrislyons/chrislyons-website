# Dieter, The Winged Saint

C. Lyons

Dieter, how dare you sit there 

perched on her shoulder

singing songs that make

her world less colder.

Don’t you know, bird

that I once did the same,

that we’ve traded our places

in this game.

For now I’m trapped

in a cage with a window

and you’re making sweet love

to my love come of age.

And in cruel contrast

where I once failed fucking

you’re playing her heartstrings

with your plucking.

Dieter you bastard,

you glorious hero.

You’re what my girl needs most,

you’re Nero.

You set all of her 

painful memories on fire

and fly to the sun

capturing all her desire

in chromatic likeness

and astral freedom.

Dieter I beg you,

turn my life into hers

for if ever a person deserved

one more day to observe

all the beauty in this world

I would gladly surrender my

day to her, yes

I would gladly surrender my

day to her.
