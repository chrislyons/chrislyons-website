Some other day, maybe I’ll stay

/ Head in the breeze, hand on your gun.

/ Head in the breeze, hand on your gun.

Some other day, maybe I’ll stay

/ Head in the breeze, hand on your gun.

But when I have you

inside these arms…

I’m all around you

I just hold you,

call your name!

Because I told you that I live my life on the run.

Yeah you can see me passing days on the run.

Yeah I just go through my life on the run.

And you can see me spending my life 

on the run.

Yeah I just go through my life on the run.

And you can see me spending my life 

on the run.
