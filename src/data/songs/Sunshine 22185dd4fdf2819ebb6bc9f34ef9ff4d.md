# Sunshine

C. Lyons

The way your laughter 

makes me feel inside,

it’s enough to make me

want to lose my mind –

and I may have lost mine..

Because the times that used to be bad

are just the times now.

And good times they still come around,

but now I find I just don’t feel myself at all.

The satisfaction when I’m by your side.

It’s so nice I want to be there all the time,

if only the world were kind..

Because the times that used to be bad

are just the times now.

And good times they still come around,

but now I find I just don’t feel myself at all.

You’re so far away..

Every time I see you,

you go so far away..
