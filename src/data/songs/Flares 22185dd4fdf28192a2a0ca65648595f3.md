# Flares

C. Lyons

I used to spend my time listening

to your vision,

to your dreams.

You were so busy,

and I was so in love..

I started putting up flares years ago.

But it didn’t matter then, 

and it don’t matter now.

You were far too busy,

and I was far too gone.

This boat is spinning in the dark,

and I get the sense that it’s fine

with everyone but my lonely heart

it keeps aching all the time

for the arms that I haven’t felt

since you punched me in the yard

back when we laughed about everything

‘til it all fell apart.

It’s time to get myself out of here

if no one’s answering.

Pressing on then, to find

wherever you are.

I started putting up flares years ago.

But it didn’t matter then, 

and it don’t matter now.

You’re still far too busy,

and I’m so far gone.
