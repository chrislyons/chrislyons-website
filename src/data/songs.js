<p>So many towns that we have found.</p>

<p>Found and then ignored.</p>

<p>Punch the screen cuz it won’t</p>

<p>break my hand at all,</p>

<p>I have told you this before.</p>

<p>Cloudy days and starflower nights,</p>

<p>all around us.</p>

<p>wandering their harmonies,</p>

<p>they’re boundless.</p>
