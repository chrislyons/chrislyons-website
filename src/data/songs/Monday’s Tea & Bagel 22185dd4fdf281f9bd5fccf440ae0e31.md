# Monday’s Tea & Bagel

C. Lyons

The sun in my eyes

makes me warm,

shoulders & thighs.

Through cotton,

through glass… maybe plastic,

wishing I was naked.

You don’t know what you do

when you walk by, unassuming.

These stone steps get cold enough

for me to get up and chase you.

Your shadow looms large,

and it’s beside me but I’m still chilly.

The sun sure is nice, but not when it’s lonely.

Girl, am I lonely without you.

You don’t know what you do

when you walk away, unassuming.

These small shoes get so big

that I don’t know what to do.
