# Failures in Forgiveness

C. Lyons

Some really have it ugly,

dropped into the boil

without ever asking

for anything but joy.

You and I, we’re different.

We’ve never had to try.

So now we don’t know how to

and it’s rotted out our lives.

And all we had was friendship,

that’s all we had to show,

but somehow that was too much

and why I’ll never know.

And it’s Failures in Forgiveness

that will keep us standing still

while the river flows around us

and the child rolls down the hill.
