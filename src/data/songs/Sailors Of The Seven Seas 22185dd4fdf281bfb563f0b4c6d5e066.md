# Sailors Of The Seven Seas

C. Lyons

Missus wishes and 

Mister listens for their

chance at the dancefloor;

dance at the chancedoor.

Veterans of the ocean, 

waiting for the shore.

Sailing on the seven seas, 

lost but caught in harmony,

for sure.

Sailors of the seven seas,

she for he and he for she,

for sure.

“Dance me through the shadows 

til I’m gathered safely in”

Captain called to captain,

rather drearily.

“There’s no trouble that I see

if I can find you on the starboard

looking out to me.”

Hugs and kisses and

moonshine fishes they

waltz together in the moonlight.

Cloudy days and starflower nights,

they’re all around us,

all around us.

Magic and mystery,

magic and mystery,

The world unfolding before us.

Yes, curious eyes see

red suns rise and

the mellow see the 

yellow in the distance.

But sailors on a sea of blue,

one and one, together two,

they’re boundless.

Sailors of the seven seas,

wandering their harmonies,

they’re boundless.

“There’s no trouble that I see

if we can find each other 

on these seven seas.”
