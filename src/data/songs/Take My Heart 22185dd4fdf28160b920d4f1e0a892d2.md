# Take My Heart

C.Lyons

Take my heart

Take my heart

Take my heart & break it in two

Take my heart

Take my heart

Without it I dunno what I’ll do

Don’t you tell me about my baby,

I’m gonna see her tonight.

I’ll tell you one thing about my baby:

I’ve got so many I can’t sleep at night..

Take my heart

Take my heart

Take my heart & break it in two

Take my heart

Take my heart

Without it I dunno what I’ll do

Sometimes I will hear her calling,

voice comes out of the blue.

Telling me about the things she dreams of,

& telling me about what I wouldn’t mind too…

Take my heart

Take my heart

Take my heart & break it in two

Take my heart

Take my heart

Without it I dunno what I’ll do
