# Know My Love

C. Lyons

I wanna know that 

when I get back 

you’ll be there

You & me on 

my front porch

watching leaves fall 

through the air

I just really wanna 

let you know my love.

Now love tell me 

when I get back

you’ll be all around me

You can throw your 

legs around my head

for all I care.

I just really wanna 

let you know my love

Now when we 

go out walkin

and I see you there 

walkin right beside me

I dunno how in the 

hell I got so lucky

but I see you there 

beside me..

I just really wanna 

let you know my love.
