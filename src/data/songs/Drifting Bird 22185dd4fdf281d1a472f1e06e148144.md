# Drifting Bird

C. Lyons

If I could know you again

I wouldn’t say those things again.

If I could see your face again

I’d give you one last kiss again.

I’d hold in the nightfall.

I’d hold you like a bird call.

If I could know you again.

If I could show you again.

If I could see your face again,

just one last embrace again.

I’d hold in the nightfall.

I’d hold you like a bird call.
