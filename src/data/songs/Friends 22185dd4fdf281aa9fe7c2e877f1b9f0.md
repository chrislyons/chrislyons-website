So what about war?

What about revolution?

What about fighting in the streets?

What about love?

What about salvation?

They’re good stories.

What about pain?

What about perserverence?

There’s no need to give in.

What about time?

What about your position?

And that train you’re waiting for?

I want you to feel this with me:

La la-la-la-la

La la-lalala-la

Lala la-la la

So what about truth?

What’s this they’re teaching?

Have they ever heard your voice?

What about friends?

What about good company?

And all the people that you aren’t?

What about rules?

Who cares what’s broken?

Count the pieces of your heart.

What about the world?

What about trepidation?

Will it end before it starts?

I want you to feel this with me:

La la-la-la-la

La la-lalala-la

Lala la-la la
