# Moonbulbs

C. Lyons

You say you want someone to hold you,

you want a man who knows the role.

All I have is what I give you

but I’ll keep digging through my soul.

You say you want someone to listen,

and you just want someone to know.

I will always listen to you,

it feeds my heart and helps me grow.

Too many moonbulbs, 

too many moonbulbs.

I’ve seen 

too many moonbulbs,

too many moonbulbs

without you.

Always knew how much I loved you,

then one day I watched you go.

Now that I don’t get to see you

I never know if I’ll get home.

There’ve been 

too many moonbulbs,

too many moonbulbs.

Too many moobulbs,

too many moonbulbs

without you here.
