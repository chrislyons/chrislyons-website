# Bootsteps

C. Lyons

Dark skies when I wake up,

the same as when I left off.

I’m wrapped up in my sweater,

off to make some things better.

Bootsteps on the street,

the only thing I’ve had to eat.

But I’m safe from the nasty weather

with a scarf that makes it better.

This is the day I draw myself

closer to the window,

over the sea that’s nowhere close

to where I need to be.

Many times I’ve wondered why

there is no time to wonder why

the things we see are done, and 

what is done is only seen by some..

I have no answers!

I’m dreaming dreams, escapist dreams,

trying to find out where I should be.

No answer to your questions,

I have no answer for you,

I’m trying to find out where I should be,

trying to find out where I should be.
