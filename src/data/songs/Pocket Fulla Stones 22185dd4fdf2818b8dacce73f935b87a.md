# Pocket Fulla Stones

C. Lyons

Hand fulla teeth, pocket fulla stones.

Kicking my feet, slingshotting home.

You say there’s plenty things to do,

how come it always dies before you follow through?

Baby without you,

Baby without you,

Baby without you,

I just don’t know.

Hands fulla teeth, pocket fulla stones.

Trick-or-treating over the phone.

Stick your little head in the sand,

but you can’t run from where you stand.

Baby without you,

Baby without you,

Baby without you,

I just don’t know.
