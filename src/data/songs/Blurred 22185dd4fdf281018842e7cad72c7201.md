# Blurred

C. Lyons

Why can’t we whittle down 

the differences between us,

chip away, away at the walls 

that we built, that we built, 

that we built so high.

Stop the tape and let’s 

put it in rewind, watch our lives 

our lives our lives fall backwards,

get back to the better times.

So many streets we’ve seen 

and been a-walking down.

So many towns that we have found.

Found and then ignored.

Punch the screen cuz it won’t 

break my hand at all,

and I need to let something go;

need to let it fall.

Some days I worry that you 

never take me seriously,

and curiously it seems like 

I have told you this before.

Master of that trade they call indifference,

and I don’t really see the sense in it.

Might as well act while you’re alive.

Swept away by all that you hold high,

I just watch it and I sigh,

and when you get there 

you close your eyes.

Laugh me off if you want 

but I won’t quit at this,

you know my heart 

pumps stubbornness 

and yours just makes 

you tired.
