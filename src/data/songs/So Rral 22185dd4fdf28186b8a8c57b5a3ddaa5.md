# So Rral

C. Lyons

Your pilgrim spirit comes to me in my dreams,

you lead me through these fantasies.

And I’m grateful just to see that you care for me;

I get lost amidst the sea.

And you play for me your whimsy and your melody,

the things that bring me to my knees.

And the daylight finds me whispering:

“come back to me.”
