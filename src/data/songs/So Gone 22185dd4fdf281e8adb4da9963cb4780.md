# So Gone

C. Lyons

You brought me to the top

of those wrought iron stairs

telling all of your ghost story lore

With my head in the breeze

and your feet in the leaves,

and I still don’t know just why

or what for.

I don’t need to be led around anymore.

I don’t need to be led around anymore.

You told me you’d meet me

time and time and time again

at the local roastery.

Seldomly seen,

we speak so serene,

and I still don’t know exactly 

what we mean.

I don’t need to be led around anymore.

I don’t need to be led around anymore.

Yeah this mailbag’s full and going ignored

and spilling onto the floor.

And I don’t need to be led around anymore.

Yeah this collar’s so old and its leather torn

that it’s just no use anymore.

So I’ll see you in the green, green grass,

if you can find me.
