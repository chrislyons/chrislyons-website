# All The Time

I’d like to see you when it’s sunny.

I’d like to see you when it’s sunny.

I’d like to see you when it’s sunny.

I like to see you – oh!

I’d like to see you when it’s raining.

I’d like to see you when it’s raining.

I’d like to see you when it’s raining.

I like to see you – aa!

But sometimes I gotta just go for days 

without seeing you!

It hurts me in this most peculiar way, 

I can’t explain to you!

I’d like to see you when it’s windy.

I’d like to see you when it’s windy.

I’d like to see you when it’s windy.

I like to see you - oh!

Yeah I’d like to see you

, when it’s snowing!

, when it’s raining!

, when it’s sunny!

, when it’s w-w-w-w-windy!
