# Saskachussets

C. Lyons

There’s not enough weed in the world

to get over a friend like you.

Trying to believe again

after seeing it split in two.

What did I do?

What did I do?

Pace ‘round the floor of my apartment,

I’m thinkin’ about you.

Think there’s a thing on tonight,

but it’s only half-past two.

There’s nothing to do.

There’s nothing to do.

I never expected to get old 

without hearing from you.

I stare at the map sometimes

but I know not to write to you.

It’s a bad thing to do.

It’s a bad thing to do.

You say it’s a bad thing to do.

You know I know that you know

who I’m singing this song to.

Hard to believe all this time

I’ve been chasing after you.

I really need you.

I really need you.
