# The Dumb Fambly Song

C. Lyons

When I was a child

my mother would sing to me

about people I didn’t know

and I could let my mind go wandering,

but never too far from home.

When I was a child

my father would play for me

his favourite TV shows,

his favourite records and movies.

They were all he had to show.

Me & my brother:

we used to fight as much we’d play.

Me & my brother:

we’re still friends to this day.

When I was a child

my mother would travel 

and I’d think about the world

I’d go outside and ask it to protect her

and she aways made it home.

When I was a child

my father would ramble on

about highways in the snow

and how far to go to get to Toronto

and he always made it home.

One day it all went dark

and I was troubled, troubled, troubled

by the way we all gave in

to the lying, cheating, hating,

and I wonder how it is

that such a sunny group of people

can make everything so grim

with their lying, cheating, hating,

hey!
