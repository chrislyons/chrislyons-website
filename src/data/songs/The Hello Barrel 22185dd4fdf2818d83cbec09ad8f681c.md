# The Hello Barrel

A. Smith, C. Lyons

Promise not to bother,

just saying hello!

We’re letting the grass grow long,

we’re letting the grass grow.

Just singing a hello song,

just saying hello!

Promise not to argue,

just saying hello!

Heading off to Montreal,

heading off next weekend!

Saying hello!

[Barreling around 

the universe 

is all we know:

we enjoy the show.]
