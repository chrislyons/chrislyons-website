# 2-Bit Blues

C. Lyons

When I finally find you

I don’t wanna know your name.

When I finally find you

I don’t wanna know your name.

I just wanna hold you

every night and every day.

I just wanna hold you

every night and every day.

Cuz baby I love you

like a dog loves the day.

Baby I love you

more than I can say.

I’m just stuck here, sittin,

watchin it roll away.

I’d like to know what you think

I could do to get on with my day.

So baby I’ll

yeah baby I’ll

be here for you.

Whenever you’re feeling the need

to be a part of two.
