# The Wind & Me

C. Lyons

There’s a little leaf that found 

its little way into the bedroom.

Pick it up and hold in the window 

and let the sun shine through.

That warm little glow that happens is golden.

It’s how I feel when I’m thinking about you.

And I feel you, yeah

I feel you.

This jar of memories is old

but I can still feel your glow,

I can still feel you blowing in the wind.

I remember you told me

you don’t care where you’re going

you just live like a leaf blowing

in the wind.
