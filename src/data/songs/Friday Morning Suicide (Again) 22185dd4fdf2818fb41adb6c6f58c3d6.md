# Friday Morning Suicide (Again)

C. Lyons

When morning calls the sun up

I’ll be waiting by the stream.

There we can smell the raindrops,

they’ll be hangin’ on the green..

I’ll see you then.

Paulie calls the office,

tells them she’ll be going on leave.

She don’t like where it’s heading,

but there’s gotta be relief.

And she knows just how it feels

when it creeps up like it’s real.

Such a lonely pain, yeah

it’s Friday Morning Suicide again.

On the day they sold you

there was nothing in your knees.

Pulled you down like an anchor

as you were flying your trapeze.

And you know just how it feels

when it sneaks up like it’s real

and it eats your brain, yeah

it’s Friday Morning Suicide again.

When morning calls the sun up,

I’ll be waiting by the stream.

Pour your cup of coffee

and come meet me on the green.
