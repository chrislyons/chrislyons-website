# The Flashing Light In Your Eyes As You Move Rapidly Beneath The Treetops

C.Lyons

If they kill me,

if the seas turn nuclear green:

I’ll be swimming in music,

floating in dreams.

If they kill you,

if the skies forget to be blue:

I will cease to function,

meditating on you.

Oh I need to find a better way of life,

all this anxiety bubbling up 

and boiling over the side.

Oh I need to find a better way of life,

cuz if I had a house I’d welcome you inside.

If you take my hand 

it’ll make my face turn red

cuz the look in your eyes 

makes all the blood rush to my head.

And between you and me 

I’ve never cared for gold,

but if I had you 

I wouldn’t mind getting old.

Oh I need to find a better way of life,

all this anxiety bubbling up 

and boiling over the side.

Oh I need to find a better way of life,

cuz if I had a house I’d welcome you inside.
